Input
The application accepts input from the user from the text entered in the specified input field, which representing a task ment for inclusion in the ToDo list. In addition, the user engages with the application by clicking the "Add Task" button to submit a task and the "Delete" button to take it out from the list.

Process
To handle the ToDo list, the app uses React's 'useState' hook. When a user enters text and selects "Add Task," the 'addTodo' method changes the state by adding the new task to the list. In contrast, when the user hits the "Delete" button, the'removeTodo' method changes the state by deleting the specified task from the list. The'map' function is used to dynamically show ToDo items based on their current status.

Output
The output of the application is a dynamic ToDo list displayed on the user interface. Each ToDo item shows the task description and a "Delete" button. The list updates in real-time as the user adds or removes tasks.

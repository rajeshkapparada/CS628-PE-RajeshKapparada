Input

To start a new React application, run 'create-react-app'. Create a MovieList component that has an array of movies, each with title, genre, and release year. Present the list to highlight these features, and include a filtering functionality via a dropdown menu to sort movies by genre. Additionally, build an event that generates a alert displaying the movie title when a movie is clicked. Use JSX for dynamic rendering, useState for state management, and import/export statements** to structure your project. Style the components with CSS.


Process 

Begin by creating the project using 'create-react-app' and constructing a fundamental structure. Create a new 'MovieList.js' component and declare a array of movie objects. Use the useState hook to handle the chosen genre. To filter movies based on the choices, add a dropdown menu that lists distinct categories, including "All Genres". Dynamically render the movie list with JSX, presenting the title, genre, and release year in a visually pleasing manner. Use a click event handler to display an alert containing the movie title. Enhance the visual presentation with CSS to create a more polished user interface.


Output

The React application provides a user-friendly interface with a movie list and genre filtering option. When you click on a movie, a popup alert displaying its title appears, delivering a seamless and dynamic user experience with elegant styling.

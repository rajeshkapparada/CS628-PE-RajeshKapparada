Input
The program asks for information about a city, like its name, country, and population. This information is entered by the user on the "Add City" page. Users can also click on any city from the list to view its details.

Process
When a user submits the form, the program takes the city details and processes them (in a real app, this would be saved somewhere). React Router helps in moving between different pages, like showing the list of cities or displaying the details of a clicked city. The app also uses the useParams hook to fetch and show information for a specific city when a user clicks on it.

Output
The app shows the information entered for the cities. The Cities List shows all cities, the City Details page shows more info about a city, and the Add City page allows users to add new cities. After adding a city, the user is sent back to the list of cities.
